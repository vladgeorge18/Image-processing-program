Image processing program 

Program implemented with Quadtree data structure used on images represented as PPM files to:
1. Compress the image (-c factor, factor=level of compression)
2. Decompress the image(-d)
3. Flip horizontally (-m h) or vertically (-m v) the image

Run the program using the command:
./quadtree [-c factor | -d | -m type][input_file][output_file]
